AI Researcher Prompt Bank
Be the Human AI Can’t Replace — Resume & Interview Kits to Stand Out
Tailored for: Research Scientist / Applied Scientist (research-leaning) / PhD-track Roles

HOW TO USE
- Define INPUTS (topic area, JD or CFP, methods, datasets, baselines, your results).
- Define OUTPUTS (abstract length, figure/table count, tone, citation style).
- Ask for OPTIONS and rationales; keep novelty claims conservative and evidence-based.
- Prefer research language (ablations, baselines, SOTA deltas, confidence intervals, error bars, reproducibility).
