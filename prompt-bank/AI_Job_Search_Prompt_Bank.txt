AI Job Search Prompt Bank
Be the Human AI Can’t Replace — Resume & Interview Kits to Stand Out
Author: Laura Montoya (Accel AI / LatinX in AI / Accel Impact Ventures)

HOW TO USE THIS PROMPT BANK
- Always define INPUTS (role, company, job description excerpt, your raw bullets, metrics) and OUTPUTS (format, word/char limits, tone).
- Ask for OPTIONS (3–5 variations) and rationales so you can choose, not just accept.
- Add CONSTRAINTS (e.g., “<= 26 words”, “metric first”, “ATS-friendly, no tables”).
- Guard ETHICS: “Use only the facts and numbers I provide. Do not invent details.”
- Push back when outputs are generic, too long, or inaccurate (see Push-Back Prompts).

- “Do not invent facts. Use only the numbers I provided; if missing, propose how to measure them.”
- “Adjust tone to confident, not boastful. Keep verbs strong; cut adverbs and buzzwords.”
- “Make it ATS-safe: plain text, simple bullets, no tables/headers/footers.”
- “Explain your changes in 2 bullets so I can learn your rationale.”
